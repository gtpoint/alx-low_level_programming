# 0x08-recursion

In this project, I learned about recursion in C.

## Tests :
+ [tests](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x08-recursion/tests) : Folder of test files.

## Header File :
+ [main.h](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x08-recursion/main.h) : Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in this project.

| File         | Protoype |
| ------------ | -------- |
| 0-puts_recursion.c | `void _puts_recursion(char *s);` |
| 1-print_rev_recursion.c | `void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);` |
| 2-strlen_recursion.c | `	int _strlen_recursion(char *s);` |
| 3-factorial.c | `	int factorial(int n);` |
| 4-pow_recursion.c | `	int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);` |
| 5-sqrt_recursion.c | `int _sqrt_recursion(int n);` |
| 6-is_prime_number.c | `int is_prime_number(int n);` |
| 100-is_palindrome.c | `int is_palindrome(char *s);` |
| 101-wildcmp.c | `int wildcmp(char *s1, char *s2);` |

## Tasks :
+ #### 0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget
  - [0-puts_recursion.c](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/0-puts_recursion.c) : C function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
 
+ #### 1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together
  - [1-print_rev_recursion.c](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/1-print_rev_recursion.c) : C function that prints a string in reverse.

+ #### 2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange
  - [2-strlen_recursion.c](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/2-strlen_recursion.c) : C function that returns the length of a string.

+ #### 3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling
   - [3-factorial.c](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/3-factorial.c) : C function that returns the factorial of a given number.

+ #### 4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate
   - [4-pow_recursion.c](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/4-pow_recursion.c) : C function that returns the value of a number `x` raised to the value of an input `y`.

+ #### 5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer
   - [5-sqrt_recursion.c](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/5-sqrt_recursion.c) : C function that returns the natural square root of a number.
   - If `n` does not have a natural square root, the function should return `-1`.

+ #### 6. Inception. Is it possible?
   - [6-is_prime_number.c](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/6-is_prime_number.c) :  C function that returns `1` if the input integer is a [prime number](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/bjG_8Gu-_0rwbYA_tAv2Yw), otherwise return `0`.

+ #### 7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything
   - [100-is_palindrome.c](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/100-is_palindrome.c) :  C function that returns `1` if a string is a palindrome and `0` if not.
   - An empty string is a palindrome

+ #### 8. Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...
  - [101-wildcmp.c](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/101-wildcmp.c) :  C function that compares two strings and returns `1` if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return `0`.
  - `s2` can contain the special character `*`.
  - If the strings can be considered identical, the function returns `1`.
  - Otherwise, the function returns `0`.
