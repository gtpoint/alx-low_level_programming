# C - Hello, World

In this project, I learned about compilation using `gcc`, how to using `main` function.

### All Tasks Here :

+ 0. Preprocessor
  - 0-preprocessor: Bash script that runs a C file saved in the variable `$CFILE` through the preprocessor and saves the result in the file c.
  
+ 1. Compiler
  - 1-compiler: Bash script that compiles a C file saved in the variable `$CFILE` that does not link, saves the result in an output file of the same name but with a `.o`    extension.
     - Example: If the C file is `main.c`, the output is `main.o`.
