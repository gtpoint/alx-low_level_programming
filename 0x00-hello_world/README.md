# C - Hello, World

In this project, I learned about compilation using `gcc`, how to using `main` function.

### All Tasks Here :

+ [0. Preprocessor](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor)
  - 0-preprocessor: Bash script that runs a C file saved in the variable `$CFILE` through the preprocessor and saves the result in the file c.
  
+ [1. Compiler](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler)
  - 1-compiler: Bash script that compiles a C file saved in the variable `$CFILE` that does not link, saves the result in an output file of the same name but with a `.o`     extension.
     - Example: If the C file is `main.c`, the output is `main.o`.
     
+ [2. Assembler](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/2-assembler)
  - 2-assembler: Bash script that generates the assembly code of a C code saved in the variable `$CFILE`, saves the result in an output file of the same name but with a     `.s` extension.
     - Example: If the C file is `main.c`, the result is `main.s`.
     
+ [3. Name](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/3-name)
  - 3-name: Bash Script that compiles a C file saved in the variable `$CFILE` and creates an executable cisfun.
    
+ [4. Hello, puts](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/4-puts.c)
  - 4-puts.c: C program that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line, using the function `puts`.
  
+ [5. Hello, printf](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c)
 - 5-printf.c: C program that prints exactly `with proper grammer, but the outcome is a piece of art,`, followed by a new line, using the function `printf`.
 
+ [6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/6-size.c)
  - 6-size.c: C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
 
+ [7. Intel](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/100-intel)
  - 100-intel: Script that generates the assembly code in Intel syntax of a C file saved in the variable `$CFILE`, saves the result in an output file of the same name but with a `.s` extension.
